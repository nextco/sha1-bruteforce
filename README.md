# Simple SHA1 bruteforce on python.

Work with dictionary of numbers|lowercase|symbols generated on memory, the length of the password is known.

## Results:
![](img/result.png)

## Currently supported on:
- Python 2.7 (Windows & Linux)

## Contains:
- SHA1.py (python script to bruteforce SHA-1)
- SHA1.cpp (cpp version, for experiment: this version is slow compared to python version)
- MD5.py (demo of adaptation to another hash algorithm)

## Usage
- Modify constants on script
<pre>
TARGET_HASH = "8e2b0f24e6f22012b834bde961cc4cc1bb6c6880"                # SHA1 to broke
TARGET_LENGTH = 8                                                       # Password length
</pre>

## Test
- Work with 1000M of dynamic memory dictionary
